Question 1:
What will you typically need to implement yourself in the programming assignments if you program in C++, Java or Python?
Answer 1:
Just the solution of the problem.

Question 2:
Your program in C, C++ or Java thinks that the product of numbers 500005000050000 and 500005000050000 is equal to -1794967296-1794967296-1794967296. What is the most probable reason?
Answer 2:
Integer overflow.

Question 3:
Which tests should you perform before submitting a solution to the programming assignment?
Answer 3:
Test on the examples from the problem statement. Then make a few other small tests, solve them manually and check that your program outputs the correct answer. Generate a big input and launch your program to check that it works fast enough and doesn't consume too much memory. Test for corner cases: smallest allowed values and largest allowed values of all input parameters, equal numbers in the input, very long strings, etc. Then make a stress test. After all these tests passed, submit the solution.

Question 4:
Where does the input data come from when you implement a stress test?
Answer 4:
You generate valid input data as a part of the stress test implementation.

Question 5:
If you submit a solution of a programming assignment, but it does not pass some of the tests, what feedback will you get from the system?
Answer 5:
If it is one of the first few tests, you will see the input data, the answer of your program and the correct answer. Otherwise, you will only see either that the answer of your program is wrong or that your program is too slow or that your program uses too much memory.
